![02](02.png)

---

## 3. Wait for Recommendations

Please wait a moment. The model will generate learning material recommendations based on the specified links & key words that I wrote on script and the current page theme.  

For example, if the current theme is **Make small talk**, the recommended links may include:
![03](03.png)


- **Youtube**  
  ![04](04.png)  
  ![05](05.png)

- **Quizlet**  
  ![06](06.png)

- **Chinese StackExchange**  
  ![07](07.png)

---

## 4. Usage Tips

The model already knows the theme and content of the current page (set via the script).  
You can directly ask questions about this content without providing additional background information.

---
## 5. Teaching Principles & Feedback

The AI follows predefined teaching principles to guide its responses. Instead of giving direct answers, it helps you discover them step by step.

See [teaching_principle.txt](teaching_principle.txt) for details.

All interactions (your answers and AI responses) are saved in [feedback.md](feedback.md) for review.
---

## 6. OCR

This module extracts text from images and non-searchable documents for further interaction with AI.

### Availability
- **Local only (for now)**  
- The OCR service runs on a China-based server, while the online app ([Streamlit](chatgpt://generic-entity?number=0) Cloud) is hosted in the US.  
- Due to cross-region restrictions, OCR cannot be used in the online version.

> Future plan: explore making this feature available online.

---

### Supported Inputs

#### 1. Image
- Upload a single image  
- Extracted text is sent directly to the chat  
- Enables immediate interaction with the model  

#### 2. ZIP (Batch Images)
- For bulk processing (recommended)  
- Upload up to ~300 images per batch  

**Suggested workflow:**
1. Put images into a folder  
2. Compress into `.zip`  
3. Upload for processing  

- Output: a single processed text file  

#### 3. PDF
- Designed for **non-searchable PDFs** (e.g., scanned textbooks, old books)  
- Converts scanned content into readable text  

**Limits & Processing:**
- Max **50 pages per run**  
- For large PDFs (e.g., 1000 pages):  
  - Split into multiple parts (e.g., 20 × 50 pages)  
  - Process each part separately  

- Parallel processing is enabled → large files can still be processed quickly (often within minutes)

- Output: a single processed text file per batch  

---

### Notes
- Batch processing may be rate-limited (~300 images/hour)  
- ZIP and PDF outputs are saved as files for later use  
- Image mode is best for quick interaction with AI models

# Chinese Learning Dataset

> A very small personal dataset built purely for learning programming and natural language processing (NLP). Nothing serious here.

🌐 Companion website: [chineselearning-longe.streamlit.app](https://longee.streamlit.app/)

---

## About

This dataset is sourced from Chinese text content. At the moment it only provides a **high-level outline skeleton** (chapter structure) — the actual content will be expanded and filled in gradually over time.

**Primary purpose:** Learning NLP techniques. That's it.

If it happens to be useful for anyone learning Chinese, great — but this is not intended as a Chinese learning resource.

---

## Current Status / TODO

### Data Cleaning
- [ ] Clean existing Chinese dataset
- [ ] Expand outline skeleton into full content
- [ ] Structure data into JSON format

### Model
Currently using supported models by Groq. It has limitations and isn't great for complex tasks, but it works fine as an experiment. Planning to find cheaper or free multimodal AI alternatives down the line. Groq has rate limits that make using agents very difficult.

---

## Roadmap: Agent Crew

Planning to build a crew of **5 agents** to handle the dataset pipeline — essentially object-oriented programming, with each agent defined as a class with its own methods and responsibilities.

### Agent Architecture

| Agent | Role | Model Complexity |
|-------|------|-----------------|
| **Agent 1 — Supervisor** | Monitors all agents, reports progress | Complex |
| **Agent 2 — Design** | Handles UI and visual design tasks | Simple |
| **Agent 3 — Deployment** | Manages GitHub / Streamlit publishing | Simple |
| **Agent 4 — Data Processing** | Scrapes and cleans Chinese text from PDFs, web pages, and raw text files; outputs structured JSON | Complex |
| **Agent 5 — Script Editor** | Takes cleaned data and refines/updates scripts accordingly | Complex |

### Workflow

```
Supervisor Agent (1)
    ├── Data Processing Agent (4) → clean text / PDF / web → JSON
    │       └── Script Editor Agent (5) → update scripts
    ├── Design Agent (2) → UI design
    └── Deployment Agent (3) → GitHub + Streamlit publish
```

---

## Stack

- **Language model:** Production Models supported by Groq
- **Web app:** Streamlit
- **Data format:** JSON
- **Deployment:** GitHub + Streamlit Cloud



- Current Status: Skeleton only; detailed content isn’t needed yet because an app will provide AI-assisted support.

- AI Support: The AI will use the outline and examples for systematic learning, guided by principles and workflow I’ll provide.

- Future Plans: Add code, upload videos, images, and more detailed materials.

- Purpose: Just started, mainly for my coding practice; not sure if it would be useful for your Chinese learning.

Teaching Principles

Here’s what I’m thinking: for example, why AI learning languages has limitations. AI lacks teaching principles. When a teacher teaches, the first goal is to help the student understand, not just deliver knowledge. AI may know language learning theory and provide resources, but it doesn’t provide teaching itself. Teaching has its own principles. I’ve studied a lot of language teaching theory —for instance, when learning a language, full immersion is the first step, which would require giving AI very specific teaching instructions. AI usually cannot judge a learner’s level and can’t use gestures or face-to-face interaction to aid understanding, but it can use images or videos. The problem is, if AI searches for resources on its own, it won’t match the learner’s level, and the results may not be appropriate.

LLM Limitations

Large language models, like Claude or ChatGPT, have context limits. Feeding in an entire book is cumbersome. You need to compress the materials into an outline and match resources according to it, which avoids context limitations. Otherwise, every query is tedious. Large models have a lot of knowledge but don’t understand teaching principles or methods—they lack “common sense” for instruction.

Solution

I plan to prepare dedicated video and image databases as backup resources for AI. I’ll also build databases for vocabulary, sentences, pronunciation, and grammar, all graded (beginner, intermediate, advanced). Images and videos will be graded as well. The different databases can be interlinked. Using Python or JSON, I’ll create key-value mappings so AI can retrieve relevant resources based on the outline without needing all content directly. Videos, images, vocabulary, grammar, sentences, and texts will all be connected to the outline, forming a large network for easy AI reference.

I plan to use agent-based division to handle these tasks. I’m still exploring and learning—treating it as practice haha.

教学常识

我现在的想法是这样的：比如说，为什么用人工智能学习语言会有局限？因为AI缺少教学理念。老师教学生时，首先要帮助学生理解，而不仅仅是传递知识。AI虽然有语言学习理论，但它提供的是资源，不是教学本身。教学有自己的原则。我以前在看过很多语言教学理论，比如学习一门语言时，第一步是完全沉浸在语言环境中，这就需要给AI特别的教学指令。AI通常分不清学习者的水平，也无法用肢体语言或面对面交流帮助理解，但可以用图片或视频辅助。问题是，如果让AI自己搜索资源，它不会根据学习者水平筛选，结果可能不匹配。

LLM的问题

大型语言模型（比如Claude或ChatGPT）有上下文限制，如果把整本书喂进去非常麻烦。必须把资料压缩成outline，然后根据outline匹配资源，这样就能绕过上下文限制。否则每次查询都很麻烦。大模型知识丰富，但并不懂教学原则和方法，没有“常识”。

解决方案

我打算准备专门的视频和图片数据库，作为AI查找资料的备用资源。同时建立词汇、句子、发音、语法等数据库，并分级（初级、中级、高级）。图片和视频也分级，不同数据库之间可以互相关联。通过Python或JSON建立键值匹配，AI只需根据outline就能查到相关资源，而不需要输入全部内容。视频、图片、词汇、语法、句子、文本等都和outline串联，形成大网络，便于AI查找。

我打算用agent分工来做这些事情，目前还在摸索和学习，把它当作练习哈哈哈。
